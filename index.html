<section>
<h2>My Past</h2>
<p>I was born in Charlotte, NC but quickly moved when I was just 2 months old to <a href="http://www.greenvillesc.gov/"> Greenville, SC </a> . Other than those two months I have lived in Greenville my whole life. I've enjoyed living in Greenville because it is not too big of a city but it is still considered one. I have played soccer ever since I was 4 years old when my best friend forced me to play with her on her team.</p>

<h2>My Present</h2>
<img class="left" src="character_day.jpg">
<P>I have 2 older brothers that are both in college. My oldest brother is 21 and is a senior at <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">  Clemson University</a>. My middle brother is 18 and is also at Clemson but is a freshman. This year is the first year that I am an "only child" because neither of them lives at the house anymore because they are both in college. It sucks because it gets so lonely but is nice because I get the bathroom all to myself.</P>

<P>I play soccer at CESA which is short for Carolina Elite Soccer Academy. I play on the u18 ECNL team which is the top level team. We travel to Florida, Alabama and Georgia for our league games. Then when we have showcases we travel to Phoenix, New Jersey and Florida again. Normally every weekend we have 2 games but we are only allowed to play a game a day because the games are so intense and take a lot of energy.</P>

<h2>My Future</h2>
<img class="left" src="future_picture.jpeg">
<p>After high school I plan on going to college to play soccer. Also I currently want to major in something around the physical therapy field. Maybe along the way I might be able to play for the <a href="http://www.ussoccer.com/womens-national-team"> US Women's National Soccer Team </a>. That has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid. But I also want to start a family when I get out of college. Then from there my life begins...</p>
